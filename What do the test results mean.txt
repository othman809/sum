If every test is successful, it signifies that the function acts as anticipated for the specified inputs. Take, for instance, the function sum(). This function correctly adds numbers together when they are presented in a list format, manages lists that contain no elements at all, and even processes lists that contain exactly one element.
A failed test indicates a bug or some other unexpected behavior in the function. For example, if total = 1 were used instead of total = 0 as the starting point for the sum() function, then the test for sum([1, 2, 3]) would fail, and the result returned would be 7 instead of the expected 6.
